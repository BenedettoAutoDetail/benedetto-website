            LEATHER GUARD COATING is made out of nanotechnology and is a Super
            Hydro-Phobic Coating that Protects, Leather, Vinylâ€™s & Plastics
            against liquids and dirt stains. It does not affect the look,
            texture, or color of the coated surface. This Innovative Coating
            ensures all dirt & spillages can be safely removed from the surface
            of the Leather, Vinyl & Plastics. (Protection lasts up to 18
            Months.) Unlike other products that can be used to protect the
            interior of the Vehicle, (Such as LEXOLE or Leather Treatment) the
            Protection & Durability of these types of products will fade away
            right away. Interior Coating will ensure Maximum Protection &
            Durability. At Benedetto Auto Detail, we are committed to delivering
            the best Interior Coating California to our customers. Contact us
